## Introduction

Speech recognition is the technology that converts spoken words into written text. This project focuses on building a system capable of recognizing speech in multiple languages using the Fleurs dataset. The system utilizes deep learning techniques to achieve accurate and robust performance across different languages.

## Dataset

The Fleurs dataset is a multilingual speech dataset containing recordings in various languages. It is specifically designed for training and evaluating multilingual speech recognition systems. The dataset is available at [Fleurs Dataset](https://example.com/fleurs-dataset).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multilingual-speech-recognition.git
   cd multilingual-speech-recognition
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the Fleurs dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

To use the Multilingual Speech Recognition System, follow these steps:

1. Preprocess the dataset:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Model Architecture

The system employs a deep learning architecture that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The model is designed to handle the complexities of various languages and accents present in the Fleurs dataset.

## Training

To train the model, use the `train.py` script. Adjust the hyperparameters in the script or provide them as command-line arguments. Training logs and model checkpoints will be saved in the `logs/` and `checkpoints/` directories, respectively.

```bash
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 64
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model on the test set using the `evaluate.py` script. This will output performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Results

Although we observe substantial variation in improvement rates between tasks and sizes, all increases in dataset size lead to increased performance on all tasks. Only a 1-point decrease in WER is shown when using the whole dataset, which adds another 12.5 to its size. We have also highlighted some of
the limitations and challenges that the field faces, such as handling background noise,
improving accuracy for non-native speakers, and incorporating contextual information.
Despite these challenges, the speech recognition and transcription project holds great promise
for the future. Advancements in technology will likely continue to improve the accuracy and
efficiency of speech recognition and transcription models, making them more accessible and
useful for a wide range of applications. With ongoing research and development, we can look
forward to further advancements in the field of speech recognition and transcription in the
years to come.
